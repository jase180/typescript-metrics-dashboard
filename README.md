# Trading Metrics Dashboard

A TypeScript/React dashboard for visualizing real-time trading metrics across multiple repositories that I made. (C++, C#, Python).

Currently using mock data for development. Will eventually integrate with live trading systems to display performance metrics, PnL, win rates, and system health indicators.

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript
- React
- (Data ingestion method TBD - considering REST API, WebSocket, or shared database)


## Pipeline
Currently doing JSON but hope to eventually feed live data
